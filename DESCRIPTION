Description: Change point detection for non-stationary time series with oscillatory patterns using fast Bayesian variable selection. The algorithm combines the Optimistic Search algorithm (Kovacs et al., 2020: Optimistic search: Change point estimation for large-scale data via adaptive logarithmic queries) and the Bayesian Sum of Single Effect regression (Wang et al., 2020: A simple new approach to variable selection in regression, with application to genetic fine mapping).
